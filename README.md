# Influencer-Detection
This is a C program that performs various operations on a graph data structure, including creating a graph, adding edges, checking if two nodes have an edge between them, calculating the indegree of a node, calculating the indegree of all nodes, and deleting nodes based on their indegree. It also has a function to calculate the total number of connections in the graph using breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a given node, and a function to parse data from a file and create a list of Person objects.
